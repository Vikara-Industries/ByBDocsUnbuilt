# DIY Neuroprosthetic Kit #
:::warning
NOT A STANDALONE PRODUCT, Requires [Muscle SpikerShield](https://backyardbrains.com/products/muscleSpikershieldBundle) 
:::

Neuroprosthetics are cutting-edge biomedical devices that bring ability back to people who have suffered neurological illness or physical injury. They also have the potential to enhance human ability as this technology develops in the future! With this kit, students can build their own neuroprosthetic "cyborg hands," which they can then control with the electrical activity of their nervous system!

This kit is a powerful, hands-on way to teach many cross-cutting concepts, like anatomy, physiology, engineering, biology, and of course neuroscience! Students can better understand how their nerves, muscles, tendons, and pulleys work together to control their hands. Students will be the engineers, designing a real prosthetic, and then brainstorming ways that this technology could help people.

Check out [the Build and Control your own DIY Neuroprosthetic: a Cyborg Hand experiment page](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/DIYNeuroprosthetic) for instructions on building it.
