When connecting via the Green Smartphone cable, only the data from channel 1 will be transfered.

Connecting via USB will allow both channels to be recorded simultaniously, as well as any addon devices.

Connecting via USB is possible on Windows, macOS, Android devices. iOS devices with a USB-C connector are supported as well, but ones with a lightning connector are not.


## Experiments ##

[What are agonist and antagonist muscle pairs?]('https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/musclespikerboxpro')

How does your [Patellar Reflex]('https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/Musclekneejerk') compare to your [Reaction Time]('https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/MusclReactionTime')?
