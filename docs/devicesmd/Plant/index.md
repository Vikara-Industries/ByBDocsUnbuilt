## Using Other Plants ##

In our experiments we focus on “behaviour plants” like the Mimosa Pudica and Venus Flytrap because they provide a reliable signal for us to measure, and they’re visually interesting as well.

You can record signals from other plants as well, however, they will probably be somewhat less reliable.
For example, we have studied about 14 different types of agricultural plants, and found about 50% have a wound response when you burn a leaf.

The most reliable “non-rapid movement” plants are the sundew (drosera), tomato, and basil plants. You wrap a wire around a branch (apply gel), put the ground in ground, and apply a flame stimulus to a leaf. A few seconds later you should see an “alarm” wound potential.
