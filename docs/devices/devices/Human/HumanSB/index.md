# Human SpikerBox #

One box to rule them all! Reveal and record the electrical activity hidden within your muscles, heart, brain, eyes and more! This easy-to-use kit allows you to record EMG, EKG, EEG, and EOG signals, giving you the power to perform human physiology experiments!

This kit is easy to use for beginners, but powerful enough to record publication-ready results! This kit can turn any home or classroom into a Ph.D. lab!

:::warning
Connecting via USB is possible on Windows, macOS, Android devices. iOS devices with a USB-C connector are supported as well, but ones with a lightning connector are not, even with an adapter.
:::

While it's possible to connect using our Green Smartphone cable, and is the only way to connect on iOS devices with a lightning connector, only the data from channel 1 will be transfered. Low frequency signals like EEG, EOG and ECG will be mostly or entirely filtered out by the phone or laptop when connecting using this method
