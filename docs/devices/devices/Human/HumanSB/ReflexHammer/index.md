The Reflex Hammer allows you to record exactly how fast your reflexes are. Take, for example, the Patellar Reflex: The Hammer's built-in accelerometer will put a marker into your recording the instant the hammer strikes your subject, while the Muscle SpikerBox Pro records from your quadriceps, capturing the EMG from your muscles the instant they contract in response to the reflex. Then, you can measure the time difference between when the hammer struck and when the muscles contracted in response, giving you the exact speed of the reflex arc!
