# Devices #

Our devices are meant to be used with our SpikeRecorder app. Although other options are certainly possible.

## What device should i get? ##

Whether you're interested in Human, Insect, or Plant electrophysiology, we've got you covered!

Here's an overview for each device in each category:
### Human ###

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col">

![HSBThumbnail](MuscleSpikerBoxPro.png)

#### [Human SpikerBox](./Human/HumanSB/index.md) ####

If you're interested in the widest range of experiments, this is the right choice. It can record 2 channels of EEG,EOG,EMG or EKG. It also supports several addon devices.
Has a built in speaker, and an expansion port so you can build your own addon devices as well.

<div class = "col">

![HHI Thumbnail](HHI2.png)

#### [Human-Human Interface](./Human/HHI/index.md) ####

You've probably seen the HHI in action. It can record 1 channel of EMG, and can also stimulate a second person's muscle. Great for demos.

<div class="col">

![H&B thumbnail](HeartAndBrainSpikerBox_product.png)

#### [Heart and Brain SpikerBox](./Human/H&BSB/index.md) ####

Can record 1 channel of EEG, EKG, or EOG. It uses the same microcontroller as the Arduino Uno, so you can write your own firmware and upload it through the Arduino IDE software.
</div>
<div class='col'>

![Muscle SpikerShield thumbnail](EMGSpikerShieldBundle_product.jpg)

#### [Muscle SpikerShield](./Human/MuscleSS/index.md) ####

Can record 1 channel of EMG. Comes with an Arduino Uno and leaves plenty of pins exposed, so if you're looking to build a human-machine interface, it's a great choice.
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">

![muscle SB thumbnail](MuscleSpikerBox_Bundle_product_thumbnail.jpg)

#### [Muscle SpikerBox](./Human/MuscleSB/index.md) ####

Can record 1 channel of EMG. 
Has a built in speaker so it's good for classrooms.
</div>
<div class = "col">

![the Claw thumbnail](theClaw_product.png)

#### [Claw](./Human/Claw/index.md) ####

The claw doesn't have a way to make EMG recordings, but it does have an EMG indicator LED array on the board itself. Great for demos and teaching about prosthetic devices.

### Insect ###

<div class="row">
<div class="col">

![NSB pro thumbnail](NeuronSpikerBox-In-Action.jpg)

#### [Neuron SpikerBox Pro](./Insect/NSBpro/index.md) ####

Can record 2 channels, which makes experiments like Measuring Conduction Velocity possible.

</div>
<div class="col">

![NSB classic thumbnail](spikerboxkit_product.jpg)

#### [Neuron SpikerBox Classic](./Insect/NSBclassic/index.md) ####

Can record 1 channel. Enables you to see and hear neuron action potentials in real time.

</div>
</div>

### Plant ###

![PlantSB thumbnail](PlantSpikerBox_product.jpg)

#### [Plant SpikerBox](./Plant/PlantSpikerBox/index.md) ####

If you're interested in the still understudied field of plant electrophysiology, this is the right choice. 


## Troubleshooting ##

For every board, first make sure that the power LED turns on, and stays on steadily.
Also try using a new battery.
If your spikerbox has a speaker or signal indicator array, we can easily check if it's getting a signal. Let's also try connecting to SpikeRecorder.

If you're having trouble connecting to SpikeRecorder, check out the [SpikeRecorder troubleshooting section](./Software/SpikeRecorder/index.md#general-troubleshooting)

Check out the individual troubleshooting section on the device page of your device.
