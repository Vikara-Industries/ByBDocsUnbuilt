# Experiments #

Welcome to the Backyard Brains experiments page for scientists, teachers and amateurs alike. Below you will find all of our open source experiments, lesson plans and useful information. If you're looking for a science fair project, several of our experiments come with suggestions. If you are an educator, you may be interested in what Educational Standards our lesson plans adhere too. Additionally, we list which specific standards are being met at the bottom of each lesson plan. For teachers interested in our experiments, check out our [Teacher's Guides section](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/teachersguide)!
