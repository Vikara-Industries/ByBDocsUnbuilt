# DIY Neuroscience Kit #

The DIY Neuroscience Kit is a great place to start learning how you can use Neuroscience in practice yourself! Using some simple arts and crafts and a bit of creative coding, you can make your own prosthesis. ( For reference, a prosthesis just means an external thing that works like a limb would. )

Hand Make Description

To get started, we’re going to need to put the prosthetic together.

## Materials ##

        -DIY Neuroprosthetic Kit

        -Scissors

        -Hot Glue Gun

        -BYB Board

        -Micro:bit

        -mini-USB cable ( connection with bluetooth is also an option )

        -Four AA batteries

        -A set of 3 electrodes

        -An EMG cable

## Steps ##

1. First, make sure to set up a work station where you’ll have everything you need, including extras if you need them! Set your glue gun aside and let it warm up while you work on the second step.

2. Take two of your straws from your bag and cut them up into 24 pieces, each one should be roughly the size of the nail of your index finger.

3. Put small dabs of hot glue in place in the segments between the sets of two holes of the fingers ( pulleys ), like this. You also want to glue five segments to the bottom of the hand ( this acts like a tendon sheath ).

You’ll be running strings through these later!

Once you’re done gluing, you’ll want to pick off all the extra “spiderwebs” of hot glue and curl the fingers so you know the fist can still close properly.

4. The long string in your bag needs to be cut into sixths. It helps to lay it next to a meter stick and cut it into equal thirds, then cut those thirds in half. Another method is to fold it in half, then fold the string again so it looks like a very flat “S”.

5. Run five of the strings through a finger, one at a time. As you run it through, pass the five plastic pieces at the bottom, leave a small amount exposed, then glue it firmly into place with the hot glue gun at the tip of the finger. Wait for each string to dry before you try to do the next one, it could slide loose.

Repeat for all five fingers.

6. From there, you need to get your motor out of its bag and find the longest white arm. The bottom–the side farthest from the flat pieces–should be put onto the servo. Make sure not to glue it into place, it should lock in by itself. 

![8](8.jpg)

7. This next step is more about the orientation of the servo than physically doing anything. Take the flat set of three wires that comes from the back of the servo. Then, orient the servo so that that set of wires is facing you. 

![9](9.jpg)

8. Use the pencil from the kit bag and draw a rough outline of the shape of the servo into your flat slab of balsa wood, like so.

![10](10.jpg) 

9. Then take a pair of scissors and cut out that small piece of wood. You could alternatively just cut the longer side off, then weaken the shorter section to snap it off by hand. Be careful, the wood is easy to break and you could fracture the whole slab of balsa wood.

10. Next, place the servo into the slot you cut out with the servo wire facing you. Glue the top and left sides on the top and the bottom of the slab of balsa wood.

11. Glue the pencil to the white arm, applying glue on both the pencil side and the arm. Let it dry, and when it's done, attach it to the servo so that the tip of the pencil is over the top of the slab.

12. Use your hot glue gun to glue the hand to the top of the slab.

![14](14.jpg)

13. Once everything is glued on, cut off the hand strings so they’re all about an inch past the edge of the hand.

![15](15.jpg)

14. Use your last string section to tie together the hands strings. 

![16](16.jpg)

The knot works by first gathering the finger strings together, then you wrap a string around them. When the loop is done, put the right side of the string through the left side of the loop, and the left side of the string through the right side of the loop. Pull, and it's done! Repeat as much as you feel necessary, just leave a string to tie around the pencil.

![17](17.jpg)

15. Take that section and wrap it around your pencil a few times, tying a knot like the one you tied for the hand strings. Make a loop around the pencil, then tuck the string through the loop and pull. When you’re done, make sure to put a bit of hot glue on top so that the string doesn’t slip off the pencil.

16. Once that is all set up, you’re going to want to get out your Backyard Brains Board and the micro:bit. You will also need a mini-usb to connect your micro:bit to your computer.

![19](19.jpg)

17. Make sure to put it into the slot with the metal strips on the opposite side. This will give information to and transmit data through the micro:bit, so you’re going to want to make sure it's pushed all the way in and not angled out.

18. For your EMG electrodes, you have two that have to be put on a muscle ( negative and positive ), and one ( the ground ) that needs to be put somewhere bony. For this, one good place would be to put the two on the right side of your forearm–about a half an inch apart.

And the other on the back of your hand.

19. Then take your EMG chord. It should have one black-tipped clamp and two red-tipped clamps.Now, you have to clamp the two red wires onto the two on your forearm.

![27](27.jpg)  

And the one black chord on the electrode on the back of your hand.

20. Plug it into the post here on your board and you can now send and receive EMG data!
