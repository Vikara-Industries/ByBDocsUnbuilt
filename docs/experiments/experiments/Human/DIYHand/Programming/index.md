# Micro:bit introduction #

When coding in micro:bit, you need to understand a few things. For example, the micro:bit chip you’re using with the Backyard Brains board uses things called “pins”, those are the gold-colored things at the bottom of your micro:bit chip. These pins have numbers and when you’re coding, you have to remember which pins do what.

Depending on which board model you’re using, the pin for anything to do with your hands servo should be P8 ( pin 8 ) or P1 ( pin 1 ). For any pin, you’re going to write it with a capital “P”, then a number between 1 and 9.

And, for receiving signals from your electrodes, you’re going to want to use P0 ( pin 0 ). This pin takes in data and also sends it.

Which is another topic. Some pins, like P8, only SEND data, and can’t receive it. These are called “Writepins”, and you’ll see how we use them later.

As for how you’re going to code, there are three menus. One for coding with blocks, another for coding with JavaScript and one for Python. Each of these are called languages. With these languages, we can tell anything electronic what we want it to do.

Now that you have an idea of how it all works, good luck coding!
