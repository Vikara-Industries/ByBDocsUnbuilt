  "description": "Python is seen by many as a kind of universal coding language. It's simple, doesnâ€™t require you to define anything but what the variables are equal to, and the process of making functions and editing variables is super easy. This will be a good entry point into coding if you want to learn the barebones concepts and still write it yourself without any blocks.",
