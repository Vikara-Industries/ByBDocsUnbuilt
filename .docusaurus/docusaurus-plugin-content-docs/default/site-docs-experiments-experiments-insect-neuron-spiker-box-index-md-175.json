  "description": "Did you just get a SpikerBox, and are wondering how to use it? In this lesson, you will listen to action potentials and view \"spikes\" in real time. This is an excellent starting point for your SpikerBox as well as a great nervous system lab for students as young as middle school! See live action potentials in an engaging lab activity!",
